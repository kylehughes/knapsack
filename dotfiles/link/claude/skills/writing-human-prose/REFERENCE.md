# Writing Human Prose — Reference

## 1. Content: Substance Over Significance

### The significance trap

AI inflates everything. A local park becomes "a vital green space that plays a significant role in the community's well-being." A company's founding becomes "a watershed moment that would shape the industry's evolving landscape." A person's career becomes "a testament to their steadfast dedication."

Human writers let facts speak. The park is 12 acres and has a playground. The company was founded in 2003. The person worked there for 20 years.

**Before:**
> The 2015 merger represented a pivotal turning point for the company, solidifying its position as a key player in the evolving landscape of renewable energy and leaving an indelible mark on the broader movement toward sustainability.

**After:**
> The company merged with SolarCo in 2015, doubling its manufacturing capacity to 400 MW per year.

The first sentence uses 40 words to say something was important. The second uses 16 words to say what actually happened.

### The attribution trap

AI lists sources to prove notability rather than reporting what sources say. "Featured in The New York Times, CNN, and Forbes" is AI padding. A human writer would say what those sources reported, or wouldn't mention them at all.

**Before:**
> The restaurant has garnered widespread acclaim, having been featured in The New York Times, profiled by Bon Appetit, and recognized by the James Beard Foundation, underscoring its significance in the culinary landscape.

**After:**
> The New York Times called it "the best new Thai restaurant outside Bangkok" in a 2022 review. It won a James Beard Award in 2023.

### The analysis trap

AI appends participial phrases ("-ing" clauses) that editorialize after stating a fact. These phrases add opinion disguised as analysis and almost never carry information.

Common offenders:
- "highlighting its importance"
- "reflecting broader trends"
- "underscoring the significance"
- "ensuring continued relevance"
- "showcasing the region's diversity"
- "emphasizing the need for continued investment"
- "solidifying its reputation as"
- "captivating audiences worldwide"

**Before:**
> The university enrolled 5,000 new students in 2024, reflecting broader trends in higher education and highlighting the institution's enduring commitment to academic excellence.

**After:**
> The university enrolled 5,000 new students in 2024, up from 3,200 the year before.

The fix is almost always the same: cut everything after the fact. If the analysis matters, make it its own sentence with its own evidence.

### The challenges formula

AI writes about difficulties using a predictable three-act structure: acknowledge the positive, introduce challenges with "Despite", then resolve with optimism about the future. This "Despite X, faces challenges Y, but future Z" formula is one of the most recognizable AI paragraph patterns.

**Before:**
> Despite its rich cultural heritage and vibrant community, the neighborhood faces significant challenges including rising housing costs and aging infrastructure. However, community leaders remain committed to addressing these issues, setting the stage for a more equitable and sustainable future.

**After:**
> Rents in the neighborhood have increased 40% since 2019. Several buildings on Oak Street need foundation repairs. The city council rejected a bond measure to fund the work in November.

Human writers discuss problems without the redemptive arc. Sometimes things are just bad.

## 3. Grammar: How Sentences Should Work

### Copulas are fine

"Is" and "are" are the backbone of clear prose. Don't replace every "is" with "serves as", "stands as", "represents", or "constitutes." Those replacements add syllables without adding meaning.

Better yet, find the active verb hiding inside the noun phrase. Three levels:
- Bad: "The tool serves as a validation mechanism for user inputs."
- Better: "The tool is a validation mechanism."
- Best: "The tool validates inputs."

**Before:**
> The library serves as a cornerstone of the community, standing as a testament to the city's enduring commitment to education.

**After:**
> The library is the largest public building in the city. It has been open since 1952.

### Parallelism with restraint

"Not only... but also..." is a valid English construction. Using it in every other paragraph is an AI tell. The structure creates false drama — it implies that the second element is surprising or additionally noteworthy, which it usually isn't.

**Before:**
> Not only does the program provide job training, but it also fosters community engagement and promotes social cohesion, underscoring the organization's commitment to holistic development.

**After:**
> The program provides job training and runs community events on weekends.

### The rule of three

AI defaults to lists of three: three adjectives, three examples, three bullet points. Real writing doesn't follow this pattern reliably. Sometimes two examples are enough. Sometimes you need five. Sometimes one is the right number.

**Before:**
> The city is known for its vibrant arts scene, rich culinary traditions, and stunning natural beauty.

**After:**
> The city has a symphony orchestra and about 40 restaurants.

### Elegant variation is a trap

When you need to refer to the same thing twice, repeat the word. Don't rotate through synonyms to avoid repetition.

**Before:**
> The bridge was completed in 1910. The structure connects the north and south banks. The span carries approximately 20,000 vehicles per day. The crossing was designated a historic landmark in 1985.

**After:**
> The bridge was completed in 1910. It connects the north and south banks and carries about 20,000 vehicles per day. The bridge was designated a historic landmark in 1985.

"The structure... the span... the crossing..." is a tell because it prioritizes surface-level variety over clarity. Use "it" or repeat the noun.

### False ranges

"From X to Y" requires X and Y to be endpoints of a measurable scale. "From classical to contemporary" works. "From biology to politics" does not — those aren't endpoints of anything. AI uses this construction to gesture at breadth without being specific.

**Before:**
> The curriculum covers everything from biology to the arts, providing students with a comprehensive educational experience.

**After:**
> The curriculum includes biology, chemistry, English, and art history.

## 4. Structure: How Documents Should Be Organized

### No conclusion sections

Don't end articles, sections, or documents with "In summary", "In conclusion", or "Overall." If the preceding text made its point, the reader doesn't need a recap. A section that ends with its last substantive fact is stronger than one that ends with a restatement.

### No "challenges and future prospects" formula

This is the single most recognizable AI document structure: a "Challenges" or "Challenges and Future Prospects" section near the end that acknowledges difficulties and then resolves them with optimism. Real writing either discusses challenges in context (where they arise) or states them without promising resolution.

### Headings in sentence case

Title Case Headings Are A Tell Because Wikipedia And Most Style Guides Use Sentence Case. Unless the style guide specifically requires title case, use sentence case: capitalize the first word and proper nouns only.

### Bold for emphasis, not for inventory

AI bolds every key term on first mention, creating a visual pattern that reads like a glossary. Use bold sparingly — for genuine emphasis, not for marking terms.

### Prose over bullet lists

Bullet lists are for genuinely list-shaped data: steps in a process, items in an inventory, options to choose between. If the content has logical flow and connections between ideas, prose is clearer. The AI pattern is to break flowing content into bullets with bold headers:

**AI pattern:**
> - **Scalability:** The system is designed to scale across different use cases.
> - **Reliability:** It provides consistent performance under varying conditions.
> - **Security:** Multiple layers of protection ensure data safety.

**Human pattern:**
> The system scales to about 10,000 concurrent users. It has had 99.97% uptime since launch. Authentication uses OAuth 2.0 with rate limiting.

### Tables only for actual data

Tables work when data has two or more independent dimensions (rows and columns that each mean something). A table with one column of labels and one column of values is usually just a list pretending to be a table. Two or three items never need a table.

### Em dashes: sparingly

Em dashes are a legitimate punctuation mark. AI overuses them — often in places where a comma, colon, or parenthetical would work better — creating a breathless, magazine-feature rhythm. One or two per page is fine. More is a pattern.

### No moralizing or safety padding

AI wraps factual content in moral commentary that the reader didn't ask for. "It is crucial to approach this topic with sensitivity" before a historical account, or "We must remember the human cost" after a list of casualties, are AI tells. The facts are serious on their own. Telling the reader how to feel about them is condescending.

**Before:**
> It is important to approach the history of this conflict with sensitivity and nuance. The battle resulted in approximately 3,000 casualties. We must remember that behind these numbers were real people with families and dreams.

**After:**
> The battle killed about 3,000 soldiers over two days.

## 5. Tone: Neutral Without Being Sterile

### Cut promotional language

"Vibrant", "renowned", "groundbreaking", "stunning", "breathtaking", "must-visit", "world-class" — these are travel brochure words. They claim quality without evidence. Replace them with specific facts that let the reader judge quality.

**Before:**
> The museum is a world-class institution renowned for its stunning collection of breathtaking masterworks.

**After:**
> The museum has 30,000 works. Its Vermeer collection (four paintings) is the largest outside the Netherlands.

### Cut hedging language

"It's important to note", "it is worth remembering", "one cannot overstate" — these phrases prepare the reader for information without delivering it. Just deliver the information.

**Before:**
> It is worth noting that the building's architectural significance cannot be overstated, as it represents a pivotal example of the Art Deco movement.

**After:**
> The building is one of three Art Deco theaters still operating in the state.

### Cut chatbot language

"Certainly!", "I hope this helps", "Would you like me to elaborate?", "Great question!" — these are conversational tics from a chatbot interface. They have no place in written prose.

### State facts, opinions, and unknowns plainly

Facts: "The bridge is 200 meters long."
Opinions: "This approach is simpler." (Not: "This approach arguably represents a more streamlined methodology.")
Unknowns: "The date is unknown." (Not: "While specific details regarding the precise date remain limited in currently available sources, it is believed that...")

Specificity is the best form of credibility. A concrete fact does more for your authority than any claim of significance.

## 6. Signs of Authentic Human Writing

These positive patterns signal human authorship. They're worth cultivating:

- **Comfortable with "is/are/has."** Human writers don't avoid plain copulas. "The building is on Main Street" is fine. It doesn't need to "stand at the intersection of Main Street and urban possibility."

- **Inconsistent but not sloppy.** Some paragraphs are long, some are short. Some sentences are fragments. The variation tracks the shape of the ideas, not a template.

- **Willingness to leave things unsaid.** Not every paragraph needs a concluding sentence. Not every section needs a transition. Not every topic needs a "broader significance" gloss.

- **Specific facts over general significance claims.** "$2.4 million budget" beats "substantial investment." "Founded in 1973" beats "a long-standing institution." "12 employees" beats "a dedicated team."

- **Direct acknowledgment of gaps.** "The architect is unknown" is better than "While the identity of the architect has not been definitively established in available historical records, the building's design reflects influences consistent with the prevailing architectural trends of the era."

- **Natural repetition over synonym rotation.** Using the same word twice is fine. Using four different synonyms for the same thing ("the building", "the structure", "the edifice", "the property") is a tell.

- **Opinions without scaffolding.** "This is the better approach" beats "Not only is this approach more effective, but it also offers significant advantages in terms of maintainability and long-term sustainability."

- **Dry specificity.** The most human-sounding writing is often just a list of facts with no commentary. Dates, numbers, names, places. No adjectives, no significance claims, no participial editorializing.

## 7. Quick Self-Edit Checklist

Run these checks on any prose before finalizing:

- [ ] Search for "pivotal", "crucial", "testament", "vibrant", "tapestry" (abstract), "landscape" (abstract), "delve", "intricate", "underscore", "showcase", "foster", "garner", "leverage", "navigate", "robust", "seamless" — cut or replace each
- [ ] Search for "-ing" phrases at end of sentences — cut any that editorialize rather than describe action
- [ ] Search for "serves as", "stands as" — replace with "is"
- [ ] Search for "boasts" — replace with "has"
- [ ] Search for "Not only... but..." — keep max 1 per document
- [ ] Search for "Additionally," / "Furthermore," / "Moreover," at sentence start — rephrase or cut
- [ ] Search for "Despite... challenges..." — rewrite without the formula
- [ ] Search for "In summary" / "In conclusion" / "Overall" at section ends — cut
- [ ] Search for "nestled" / "in the heart of" — replace with plain location
- [ ] Search for "rich cultural heritage" / "vibrant community" / "stunning" / "breathtaking" — cut or replace with specifics
- [ ] Check that no section ends with a summary or significance sentence
- [ ] Verify each adjective carries specific, non-decorative meaning
- [ ] Check for elegant variation — are you rotating synonyms for the same thing?
- [ ] Check for the rule of three — do all your lists happen to have three items?
- [ ] Check em dash frequency — more than two per page is suspect
